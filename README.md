Hero layouts
=======================

Versions of core layouts with container classes inside the wrapper.

Usage
-----

This attempts to resolve a limitaion of the core layouts in that it allows any 
region to be made full width while allowing other regions to be fixed-width. 
Regions can be made full width by over-riding the `.container` class for that 
region.

Example:
`.l-middle .container { width: 100%; }`
(will also require over-riding the margins.)

This project also includes a new Hero region configured for core Hero Blocks 
to display full-width without further CSS adjustments.
